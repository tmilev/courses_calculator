The diagram shows a field enclosed by a wall \(AH\) and fencing along the rest of the boundary \(ABCDEFGH\). 
The angles marked with the corner symbol are right, the segment \(EF\) equals \(<calculator noTags="true">KnownLength</calculator> m\), 
\(BC= <calculator noTags="true">y cfY</calculator> m\), \(AB=DC=<calculator noTags="true">x cfXOne</calculator>m\) 
and \(DE=<calculator noTags="true">x cfXTwo</calculator>m\). It is given that the total length of the fencing (excluding the wall) is 
<calculator>fencingTotal</calculator> \(m\) and that the area of the rectangle \(HBCG\) is 
<calculator>areaFactor</calculator> times the area of rectangle \(DEFG\). 

<ul>
<li>Show that \(y=<calculator noTags="true">yFromX</calculator>\).</li>
<li>Show that \(<calculator noTags="true">1/ GCD{}( CoefficientOf(x, thePoly), CoefficientOf(x^2, thePoly) ,ConstantTerm(x, thePoly))thePoly</calculator>=0\).</li>
<li>Find the length of \(HF\). Do not forget to include the measurement unit \(m\).</li>
